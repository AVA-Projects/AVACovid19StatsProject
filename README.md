- **[Live Demo Site](https://avacovid19statsproject.netlify.app/)**



### `Get github repo`
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AVA-Projects/AVACovid19StatsProject
```
### `npm install`

Install the all using packages with npm.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

# AVA-COVID19-Stats-Project 

 A project that shows live COVID19 data on charts,maps and developed with ReactJS and NodeJS.


•	It provides customer friendly and easy to understand interface. 




• Visitor can view stats of current status of covid19 in any city or country.


**User interface contains:**

• Shows total confirmed, recovered and death COVID-19 cases by country

• Shows daily statistics for every country and world

• Shows statistics in detail graphs for every country

• Total data for COVID

• Charts

• Map

• Supports English languages (based on browser language)

## Features

**This application uses the data provided by Novel COVID API and Covid19 API
Turkey specific data provided by Covid19 Turkey API**

- This API provides a big range of detailed information about multiple viruses. From COVID19 global data overviews to city/region specific mobility data, and data on the current outbreak.
-  also provide official government data for some countries.
 
- **React Chats**
This React data visualization library is a collection of React components that helps render common data visualization charts. With React Vis, you can visualize your project data in line/bar/area charts, scatterplots, hexagon heatmaps, pie charts and more.

- **React Maps**
In React, the map method is used to traverse and display a list of similar objects of a component. A map is not a feature of React. Instead, it is the standard JavaScript function that could be called on an array. The map() method creates a new array by calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.





# React Js
-	React is one of the most popular open-source front-end JavaScript libraries used for building Web applications.
-	Before using react, it has some prerequisites that one should follow, that you must download Node packages in your system with their latest versions. Also, you must have an understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
-	It is used to build user interfaces, especially for a single page web application.
-	It allows us to create reusable UI (User Interface) components.
-	It allows developers to create large web applications that can easily change the data of the page even without reloading the page.
-	The main objective of reacting is that it only works on user interfaces in the application, whether mobile or web.
-	It is very fast, simple and scalable.
-	React is also used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks.
-	There are a lot of open-source platforms that are also used to make the front-end web and mobile applications easier, like Angular js in MVC. Now, most developers are using the MERN stack in which react is used; the main reason is that it is very fast and has more advantages over other front-end frameworks.





#  Node js
-	Node js is an open-source server environment, and it is a cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.

-	js is not a programming language, and even it is not a framework.
-	It is often used for building and developing numerous backend services like net applications, mobile applications.
-	Massive corporations principally utilize it in production like Uber, PayPal, Netflix,
-	It may be a free ASCII text file platform and may be utilized by anybody.
-	It is incredibly simple to urge started with it and may even be used for agile development and prototyping.
-	It provides extremely ascendable and really quick services to the users.
-	It is incredibly consistent and may be used as an ASCII text file cleaner.
-	It continuously uses JavaScript; thus, it's ultimately helpful for a computer user to quickly create any net service or any net or mobile application.
-	It provides a massive system for any ASCII text file library.
-	It contains a non-blocking or, can say, Asynchronous nature.


# Advantages 
1.	For a smooth development of any web application or mobile app, it supports MVC (Model View Controller) architecture; the main purpose of this architecture is to separate the presentation details with the business logic.
2.	It covers all the web development stages starting from front-end development to backend development with JavaScript.
3.	It is an open-source framework mainly used to develop web-based or mobile applications and is supported by the community.
4.	It is very fast and efficient suitable for developing large applications.
